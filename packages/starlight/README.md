# Starlight with pages-cms support (frontmatter-only-files)

## NOTE: This is a Starlight fork with the aim to also support a view with frontmatter-only-files produced by pages-cms. So some of the main Components are supported this way (eg. RTE, Code, Steps and FileTree) for rendering there is a second Page (CustomPage.astro), the basic functionality is kept and managed by the new src/lib folder. There we accomplish that still eg. the ToC works or the FileTree still can be used.

## TODO: Add a Content Example and the base Pages-CMS config to this REPO as well. (the Content for the main project will be managed by another Astro-Page)

Starlight is a documentation website framework for [Astro][astro].
